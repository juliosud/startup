> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

### Technologies

- **HTML**  
  - Main structure for the app (login and chat pages).  
  - The login page will include user input forms and error messaging.  
  - The chat page will have sections for:
    - Recommendations
    - User inputs
    - Dynamic display of macronutrient intake progress  

- **CSS**  
  - Used for style and design to ensure intuitive navigation and readability:  
    1. Chat bubbles to differentiate user and app inputs/outputs.  
    2. Dynamic progress bars for the macronutrient section.  
    3. Adaptive layouts for mobile screens.  

- **React**  
  - Handles the interactive front end. Features include:  
    1. **ChatBox Component**: Manages real-time user interaction.  
    2. **Recommendation Card Component**: Displays personalized meal suggestions.  
    3. **Progress Tracker Component**: Dynamically updates based on user goals and logs.  
  - State management to track user goals, meal logs, and chat history.  

- **Service**  
  - Manages business logic with the following APIs:  
    1. **User Authentication API**: Ensures secure login and profile management.  
    2. **Logging API**: Handles meal logging and updates progress.  
    3. **Recommendation API**: Generates personalized suggestions.  

- **DB/Login**  
  - Stores and retrieves important data:  
    1. User profiles  
    2. Nutritional logs  
    3. Restaurant data  
    4. Chat history  

- **WebSocket**  
  - Enables real-time updates and communication in the chat interface.  
  - Example Idea: Use WebSocket to update the progress tracker dynamically as the user logs meals or receives recommendations.
